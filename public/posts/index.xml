      <description>Setting Expectations It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly fifteen years since I last published anything that someone outside of my local team might read. Sure, some periodic clever Insta-posts, or LinkedIn re-shares with thoughts, but nothing I can claim for my own, and certainly nothing which I can disable commentary from the beloved public.&#xA;What you&amp;rsquo;ll begin to see roll out over the next few days are things I&amp;rsquo;ve had on my mind that I think are interesting/fun concepts, and mixed in along the way I&amp;rsquo;ll also pull back the curtain a bit on my hobbies and how I think/approach them: most notably fly fishing, and to a lesser extent ice hockey&amp;hellip;and who knows, if it gets/stays cold enough this winter - ice fishing!</description>
