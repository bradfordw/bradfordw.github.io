### Setting Expectations

It's been nearly fifteen years since I last published anything that someone outside of my local team might read. Sure, some periodic clever Insta-posts, or LinkedIn re-shares with thoughts, but nothing I can claim for my own, and certainly nothing which I can disable commentary from the beloved public.

What you'll begin to see roll out over the next few days are things I've had on my mind that I think are interesting/fun concepts, and mixed in along the way I'll also pull back the curtain a bit on my hobbies and how I think/approach them: most notably fly fishing, and to a lesser extent ice hockey...and who knows, if it gets/stays cold enough this winter - ice fishing!

With that out of the way, stay tuned ...
